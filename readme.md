# Scrumple Bookmarks

## Social Bookmarking App built with Laravel

The long-term goal for the web app is to add the ability to archive a web page along the lines of instapaper or send to kinde and also to add the ability to add code snippets as well.

I'd like Scrumple to be a general junk drawer of weblinks, archived web pages and code snippets that is easy to organize with tags.
